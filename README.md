# Flood-Prediction-on-Imbalance-dataset
Flood Prediction Task was performed modelling Logistic Regression and LSTM algorithms on Imbalance dataset
Evaluation metrics for each of the algorithms were evaluated.
Default hpyerparameters were used for Logistic Regressesion while LSTM architecture was tuned.
Train_Test_split in 80:20, training set as 80% and Testing set as 20%.
